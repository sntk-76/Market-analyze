# Market analyze
 In this project, we analyze a financial market in the data set containing four crucial values: 1. open price 2. close price 3. high price 4. low price. In this project, we just want to extract the "NYA" index and then create a linear time-price chart, and then try to recognize the noises in the data set and also handle the NAN values in the data set.
